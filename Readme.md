# Bulgur Cloud - simple and delicious cloud storage and sharing

Bulgur cloud is a cloud storage and sharing option, designed to be easy to self
host. It depends on no databases or services, and uses little resources.

## Demo

A read-only demo instance is now available at [bulgur-cloud.bgenc.net](https://bulgur-cloud.bgenc.net).

Enter the username `test` and password `test` to log in. This is set to be read only, so you will get an error if you try to upload, rename, or delete anything.

## Getting Started

Bulgur Cloud is too early in development, and does not have a release available to use yet.

Please see the demo linked above to get a sense of what it looks like.
You can see [my blog post](https://bgenc.net/bulgur-cloud-intro/) for details.

## Development

If you'd like to help with development, use Visual Studio Code to open the
project folder. You must have a working rust and nodejs setup. There are tasks
set up to build and run the backend and frontend. The backend requires a bit of
setup as you need to create a user for testing. There is no documentation for
this right now, but let me know if you are interested and I'll help with the
setup.
