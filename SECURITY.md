# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Until the version 1.x.x release, only the latest version should be considered supported.
Once version 1 is released, a more comprehensive release support schedule will be developed.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a bug that causes:
- Unauthorized access to files or data
- Unauthorized administrative actions
- Decoding of saved password hashes

Please email `kaan` at `bgenc.net`. Describe the issue, and how someone might exploit it.

For other issues where user data is not at risk, please use the [Github issues](https://github.com/SeriousBug/bulgur-cloud/issues) to report the problem.

## Vulnerability Handling

Once a vulnerability is reported, we'll work on a fix as quickly as possible.
Once the fix is released, a security advisory will be published to describe the issue, affected versions, and the solution.
