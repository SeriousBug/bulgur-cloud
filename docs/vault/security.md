Bulgur Cloud is built with focus on security first. This is made easier thanks to
the simple design of the server, which means there are fewer places with
possible vulnerabilities.

Every feature is built with security in mind. This means putting security ahead
of convenience. We follow the concept of "default deny" (things should be secure
by default, and access should be allowed explicitly).

If you believe you have found a vulnerability or potential vector of attack,
please send an email to `bulgur.cloud@bgenc.net` and I'll investigate if an
attack is possible.
